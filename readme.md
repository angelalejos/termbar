This idea came from assumption that you are using some kind of panel or
bar in your WM and that many window managers can:

* create a gap between screen edge and window border
* ignore particular window with proper settings
* show particular window on all workspaces (sticky windows)

You can replace all those conkys, bars, panels, ..  etc.  with (shell)
script running in terminal window.

This simple example is for cwm window manager in OpenBSD.
