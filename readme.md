This idea came from assumption that you are using some kind of panel or
bar in your WM and that many window managers can:

* create a gap between screen edge and window border
* ignore particular window with proper settings
* show particular window on all workspaces (sticky windows)

You can replace all those conkys, bars, panels, ..  etc.  with (shell)
script running in terminal window.
