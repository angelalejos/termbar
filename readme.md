This idea came from assumption that many window managers can:

* create a gap between screen edge and window border
* ignore particular window with proper settings
* show particular window on all workspaces (sticky windows)

You can replace all those conkys, bars, panels, ..  etc.  with (shell)
script running in terminal window.

This example is for cwm window manager in OpenBSD.
