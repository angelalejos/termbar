This idea came from assumption that many window managers can:

* create a gap between screen edge and window border
* ignore particular window with proper settings
* show particular window on all workspaces (sticky windows)

Now you can replace all those conkys, bars, panels, ..  etc with shell
script using standard UNIX tools running terminal window.
