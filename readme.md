This idea came from assumption that you are using some kind of panel or
bar in your WM and that many window managers can:

* create a gap between screen edge and window border
* ignore particular window, so it has no borders and is ignored while switching between windows
* show particular window on all workspaces (sticky windows)

You can replace all those conkys, bars, panels, ..  etc.  with (shell)
script running in terminal window.

The following image is showing termbar with current time updated
every second, running in cwm on OpenBSD. It is very simple example,
the possibilities are endless, you can output anything into termbar.
